A Minecraft Spigot plugin that lets players generate dungeons with a roguelike playstyle.

The plug allows you to:
  Build the very dungeon rooms that will be generated for the dungeon
  Battle through a dungeon with specific objectives (kill enemy objectives, flip a switch objective, etc).
  
 
 How does it work?
  The player must first build the rooms that will be used. This is simply done in Minecraft itself. After the room is built, the player selects the area being used with a wooden shovel and a wooden hoe. After the selection is made, the player writes "!sbd [roomName]" to save the room into a file.
  
  After the rooms have been made, the player simply types "!sd" and the fun begins!
