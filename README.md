A Minecraft Spigot plugin that lets players generate dungeons with a roguelike playstyle.

The plug allows you to:
  Build the very dungeon rooms that will be generated for the dungeon
  Battle through a dungeon with specific objectives (kill enemy objectives, flip a switch objective, etc).
  
 
 How does it work?
  The player must first build the rooms that will be used. This is simply done in Minecraft itself. After the room is built, the player selects the area being used with a wooden shovel and a wooden hoe. After the selection is made, the player writes "!sbd [roomName] [ObjectiveType]" to save the room into a file.
  
  After the rooms have been made, the player simply types "!sd" and the fun begins!


What is a room?
  A room is any enclosed structure with three important blocks:
    A block of green wool (The room's exit)
    A block of red wool (The room's entrance)
    The type of block the door will be made out of (this is put on top of the room's exit block).
    
Additional blocks include: zombie and skeleton heads, which get converted into the actual enemies upon loading the room.
